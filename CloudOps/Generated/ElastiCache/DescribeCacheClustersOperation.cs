By default, abbreviated information about the clusters is returned. You can use the optional ShowCacheNodeInfo flag to retrieve detailed information about the cache nodes associated with the clusters. These details include the DNS address and port for the cache node endpoint. If the cluster is in the creating state, only cluster-level information is displayed until all of the nodes are successfully provisioned. If the cluster is in the deleting state, only cluster-level information is displayed. If cache nodes are currently being added to the cluster, node endpoint information and creation time for the additional nodes are not displayed until they are completely provisioned. When the cluster state is available, the cluster is ready for use. If cache nodes are currently being removed from the cluster, no endpoint information for the removed nodes is displayed.";
