Otherwise, it returns all backups owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you&#39;re calling. When retrieving all backups, you can optionally specify the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of backups in a response. If more backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a NextToken value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response. This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your backups. DescribeBackups is called first without a NextTokenvalue. Then the action continues to be called with the NextToken parameter set to the value of the last NextToken value until a response has no NextToken. When using this action, keep the following in mind:   The implementation might return fewer than MaxResults file system descriptions while still including a NextToken value.   The order of backups returned in the response of one DescribeBackups call and the order of backups returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.  ";
