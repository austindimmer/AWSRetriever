        public override string Description => "This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see CompleteMultipartUpload. List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range.  The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a marker at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the marker is null. To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the marker request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request.  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don&#39;t have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.
